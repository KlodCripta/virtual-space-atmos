## üìã REQUIREMENTS

To make Virtual Space Atmos work properly, you need the following setup:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ PipeWire  
- **Required as your audio server**  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project will **not work with PulseAudio**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ EasyEffects  
- The main software used to load and manage the custom audio preset.  
- Install it from your distro‚Äôs package manager (e.g., `pacman`, `apt`, `dnf`).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Plugins (optional but highly recommended)

Some EasyEffects modules may require additional LADSPA / LV2 plugin packages.  

**On Arch-based systems, make sure to install:**  
- `lsp-plugins`  
- `calf`  
- `zam-plugins`  
- `mda.lv2`  
- `lilv`  
- `lv2`  
- `lv2lint` (for full LV2 support)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Headphones connected  
This preset is designed and optimized exclusively for **stereo headphones**.  

Please make sure:  
- Headphones are plugged in **before launching EasyEffects**.  
- The output profile is set to **"Headphones (Stereo)"** in your audio settings.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Enable virtual device (optional)  
If you're using multiple devices or audio interfaces (e.g., USB DACs), make sure the correct sink is selected inside EasyEffects.

---

## üì• INSTALLATION

## Arch-based system

EasyEffects and all required plugins can be installed from the official repositories (not AUR).
Run the following command:

sudo pacman -S easyeffects lsp-plugins calf zam-plugins mda.lv2 lv2 lilv

Easyeffects comes from the extra repo, fully official.
No need to enable AUR or install via Flatpak/Snap.

## Ubuntu / Mint / Debian

sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y

sudo apt install easyeffects

sudo apt install calf-plugins x42-plugins

## Fedora

Available via dnf (not tested yet).

---

### üõà Note for Arch / Arch-based users with KDE Plasma  

After installing additional plugin packages (like `lsp-plugins`, `calf`, `zam-plugins`, etc.), you may notice **dozens of new icons** appear in the **Multimedia** section of your application menu (it only happened on one of the PCs used for testing).  

These are standalone plugin UIs. **You don‚Äôt need to launch them manually** to use Virtual Space Atmos with EasyEffects.

---

### Recommended solution: hide these entries from the menu  

**Quick method (KDE Plasma):**

1. Right-click on the **Start Menu** and select **Edit Applications** (This will open **KMenuEdit**).
2. Navigate to the **Multimedia** category.
3. For each unwanted item:  
   - Select it  
   - Uncheck **"Show in menus"**  
4. Save and exit  

These entries will disappear from your app menu, but all plugins will still work properly inside EasyEffects.

---

## ‚¨áÔ∏è IMPORT THE PROFILE

1. Download the latest **`VIRTUAL_SPACE_ATMOS.json`**.  
2. Open **EasyEffects**, go to **Profiles** and click **Import**.  
3. Load **`VIRTUAL_SPACE_ATMOS.json`**.  
4. Activate the preset and enjoy!
